#Odin Recipes

_I have already done this project way back in 2022, but I abandoned the Odin Project for a long time. After I restarted, I decided I might as well start it from scratch for a refresher._

The very first lesson in the Odin Project. The goal is a simple website using only HTML that can be styled later on. The purpose of the project is to practice the very basics of HTML that I learned in the Odin Project Foundations.
